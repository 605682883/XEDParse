XEDParse is a library to parse MASM-like plaintext instructions to the XED
instruction format. The library is meant to have quick access to assembly
in certain low-level programs (such as debuggers).

Currently finished:
- parsing most instructions to an internal data structure (XMM, float etc.
  unsupported currently);
- translate the instruction base to XED2;
- translate registers to XED2;
- encode the translated structure;

Todo:
- translate memory arguments;
- translate values;
- translate relative stuff (jumps + calls + rip-relative);
- more operand types (for XMM, float etc.);

Currently the parser can be considered reasonably fast, it parses about 
200 000 instructions in 1,5 seconds.
